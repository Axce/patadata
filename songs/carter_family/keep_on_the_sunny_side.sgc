There's a [B&]dark and a [E&]troubled side of [B&]life
But there's a [B&]bright and a sunny side [F]too
Though you [F]meet with the darkness and [B&]strife
The [F]sunny side you also may [B&]view

{start_of_chorus}
  [B&]Keep on the sunny side, [E&]always on the [B&]sunny side
  [B&]Keep on the sunny side of [F]life
  It will [B&]help us every day, it will [E&]brighten all the [B&]way
  If we'll [B&]keep [E&]on the [B&]sunny [F]side of [B&]life
{end_of_chorus}


Though the storm and its furies rage today
Crushing hope that we cherish so dear
The cloud and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear


Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
And let us trust in our Saviour always
He'll keep us everyone in His care
