{guitar_comment: Intro: | [E&] [E] [F] | [E&*] [E*] [F*] |  {repeat: 2}}


[C]After all the [B&]jacks are in their [F**]boxes
[C]And the clowns have [B&]all gone to [F**]bed
[C]You can hear happiness [B&]staggering on [F**]down the street
[G]Footsteps [B&*]dressed in [E&]red[E][F]
[G]And the [B&*]wind whispers [E&]Mary[E][F] [E&*][E*][F*]


A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

| [F] [E&] | [B&*] [A&] |  {repeat: 3}

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary


Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary
